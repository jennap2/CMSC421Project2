# CMSC421Project2

When I started on the project I familiarized myself with the code provided in the files in the project assignment
in blackboard and read the project document. The TAs said online research is a great way to get started and understand 
how this project should worksso I looked for some information online. The sources I used 
were (https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/) and (https://indradhanush.github.io/blog/writing-a-unix-shell-part-2/).
