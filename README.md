# CMSC421Project2

When I started on the project I familiarized myself with the code provided in the files in the project assignment
in blackboard and read the project document. The TAs said online research is a great way to get started and understand how this project should work so I looked for some information online. The sources I used 
were (https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/) and (https://indradhanush.github.io/blog/writing-a-unix-shell-part-2/). I have had some experience with parsing strings, reading in information from files, and other things in this project, but I needed a little more information about how this all works with the shell. For the part 3 of the project for the scheduling algorithms I used the list functions provided to make the linked list for the tasks, and then created add, schedule, pickNextTask, and additional helper functions when needed. The directions for running the algorithms are in Makefile.
